data
#####
The data folder contains a reduced version of the data. In particular,
we used the data from the NYC open data on car crashes. Because the
file is too big there is a reduced version of it called ``reduced_data.csv``.
The file ``initial_data_claening.ipynb`` contains an explanation of
how this data is generated from the original dataset.

To generate all of the datasets used for the project. Run the python
script ``generate_datasets.py``
