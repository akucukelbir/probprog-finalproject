    "\n",
    "Over 1.73 million crash incidents have been reported in NYC since 2012. The magnitude of this number indicates the importance of developing and understanding of the patterns that drive this phenomenon. With the aim of achieving this objective we developed various probability models that describe how the phenomenon occurs on a day to day level in different regions within Manhattan. We perform inference on our model using Black Box Variational inference. "

    "To aggregate the data we decided to map each accident to the nearest intersection. This divided the space into a set of regions similar to those obtained by a voronoi diagram with centers corresponding to the intersections. We decided to use the average AADT over the period from 2014 to 2019 for each road as the data was not available for each individual year in most cases. Each defined regions was assigned the maximum average AADT of all roads within 10 m of the intersection location. Some roads had no AADT data available for each of these years and thus some regions were assigned no AADT. These regions were discarded so that our probability models were comparable to each other. For interpretability and inference purposes we used $\\log(AADT)$ instead of AADT and all values were divided by the absolute\n"
