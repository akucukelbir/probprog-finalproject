    "Over 1.73 million crash incidents have been reported in NYC since 2012. The magnitude of this number indicates the importance of developing and understanding of the patterns that drive this phenomenon. With the aim of achieving this objective we developed various probability models that describe how the phenomenon occurs on a day to day level in different regions within Manhattan. We perform inference on our model using Stochastic Variational inference."

However, we found this to be prohibitively computationally expensive regardless of inference method due to computations involving large spatial matrices. Since we were looking at large number of intersections, this was not a feasible model. As such, we decided to use the poisson lognormal model.\n",

This check displays a histogram of the difference between the mean accident for each node across days when the categorical predictor is 1 and the corresponding mean when it is 0. If said predictor does indeed affect the accident rate, we expect the histogram to have non-zero mean and be skewed . We can also conduct this check with non-categorical predictors by introducing a cutoff for the purpose of this check. To test whether the model is able to capture this, we plot the empirical distribution of the skew of the generated data and also plot a single sample to see whether the shapes of the histograms are similar.\n"

After studying the corresponding ELBO curves, we concluded that this was due to the ELBO not converging even after a significant number of iterations (~5000 iterations). We found that this was due to bad initialization of the guide. To prevent this, we initialize the guide a hundred times and select the initialization based on the lowest ELBO.
